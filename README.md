#  My setup for mobile pentesting :
there's some scripts i used for mobile pentesting in /scripts
## most important thing 
```dont f*cking use Drozer from the first time kiddo !!```
###  Requirement :
* Frida :
```pip install frida-tools```
```pip instal frida``` 
* apktools and JADX-GUI  : 
https://github.com/skylot/jadx
https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool

### your first steps : 

first before cloning this repo u must know that frida is dynamic instrumentation toolkit, it allows you to trace, modify, play with processes in native apps , by injection some javascript into your native application using python.
for our case we gonna use it for  native android app 'i couldn't afford an apple device for ios :( ' 
```you gotta root you device before using frida !!!!```
* and then you gotta install frida server on you device (if u have some extra ram use genymotion ;) )

* note that u gotta download the right frida server that fits your device's archi (arm64 or x86 ...)
* from terminal
``` adb push path/to/frida_server /data/local/tmp```
``` adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida_server" ```
``` adb shell /data/local/tmp/frida_server & ``` 
``---> frida will be running on the background make sure to kill it after u finish being a hacker .`` 

### this repo contains those scripts  
* ```frida_ssl_pinning_bypass.js```
bypassing ssl pinning of applications like orange android app , so u can intercept it using burp
how to launch it : 
```frida -U -l frida_ssl_pinning_bypass.js -f name.of.package --no-pause``` 
* ```pinning.js```
same as the previous script but using a http proxy without burp "from command line"
* ```Imprementation_overriding_using_frida.py```
modify the output of a methode "u must know the specific method that u want to change from reversing the apk "
* ```change_str_in_apk.py```
change string in the reversed java 

* ```bruteForcing_astatic_methode.py```
bruteforcing an input of a non static  methode 
## how to reverse a APK : 
### thats just for easy android app :
all of this is by using jadx-gui
* check ```android_manifest.xml``` if it contains some permissions to SD card or local storage ar any other services permissions 
* check layouts like ```main_activity.xml``` for hidden or hard coded strings or maybe ```resources.arsc/res/values/*.xml```  
 !!!! important dont waste time just look for ```secret , key , password , encrypted```
* then open the java ```main_activity.java``` first thing to check is oncreate methode and all the other methos and classes called inside it 
* check any kind of encryption methods and understand them 
!!!! important set a goal first and decrease ur reverse surface .
